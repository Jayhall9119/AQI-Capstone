# **AQI-Capstone**
### *Capstone project for Google Data Analytics Course*

Welcome to my Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Course. As a data enthusiast with a passion for the environment, I embarked on this project to explore the relationship between Air Quality Index (AQI) and population data in various countries. The objective was to gain insights into the potential correlations between population size and AQI levels.

## *Data Sources*
For this project, I utilized two datasets obtained from Kaggle:

[AQI - Air Quality Index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azminetoushikwasi/aqi-air-quality-index-scheduled-daily-update) 

[World Population(2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/armansayyed/world-population2022)
